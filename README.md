Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the application of engineering principles and tools to build, test, implement, and maintain software systems.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1. Development of programming languages like Fortran and C which paved the way for the creation of more advanced languages and tools.
2. Establishment of Software engineering as a discipline. This was a step in the right direction because it led to development of formal development and tools leading to  more systematic approaches to software engineering over the years.
3. Advent of structured programming. It improved software quality and productivity for developers by  making it easier to reuse, scale, and maintain code.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirement- involves gathering and documenting information about the needs of the user and the system requirements.
2. Design- here the user interface and software architecture are built
3. Implementation- this is when the actual code is written, and software is built as per the design specifications
4. Testing- involves putting the software to a test to ensure it's functional and meets software quality
   
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology entails working in phases- one task has to be completed before proceeding to the next one which takes longer to deliver the completed project whereas in agile tasks are performed in small consumable increaments enabling teams to deliver work faster.

Waterfall methodology doesn't necessarily involve the customer/user in the process which often leads to limited feedback and results to compromised product quality and in turn customer/ user disatisfaction. On the other hand, agile methodology involves the customer/user every step of the way resulting to improved product quality and customer satisfaction.

For instance because Waterfall methodology employs structured approach and extensive documentation to tasks it might be used in developing software for a medical device, where regulatory compliance is strict, and requirements are well-defined upfront. 

Agile might be used to develop a mobile app for a startup, where user needs and market conditions may change rapidly. This is because Agiles approach allows the team to pivot and adjust features based on user feedback, ensuring the product remains relevant and competitive.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software developer- they write code and implement software solutions

Quality Assurance Engineer- design and execute test plans to ensure that software is functional and meets quality standards

Project Manager- oversees planning, execution and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs provide tools for writing, debugging and testing code Examples include Eclipse and Visual studio

VCS help coordinate work among teams and also track changes made to source code. For example GIT

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Tight deadlines- can be overcome by communicating forseable challenges in a timely manner and prioritizing tasks

2. Change of project requirements during development cycle. Communication can help reduce delays in delivery. 
Agile methodology can be used here to ensure proper adjustments and help create a product that meets the customers needs

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
 1. Integration Testing- involves testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
 2. System Testing- is when testing is done to the entire software system as a whole.
 3. Acceptance Testing- is testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Is creating a set of relevant questions to get the best possible responses from AI models. It helps get specific responses to our questions.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt: Tell me about animals.

This is too broad. There are millions of animals! The AI might not know whether i'm interested in pets, wild animals, or endangered species, so the answer could be too general.

Improved Prompt: Tell me about the types of animals that live in the African savannah.

This prompt is clear, specific, and focused. I'm asking about a specific type of animal in a specific place. Now, the AI knows exactly what i'm interested in and can give a more precise and relevant answer.
